=====================================================================

Python GUI to play The Resistance. 
Uses Zelle's graphics.py library.

=====================================================================

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====================================================================

Save resistance.py. Open in IDLE and Run Module or from the command
line: python resistance.py

IDLE's shell or the command line will then prompt you to enter player
names. Do so, one by one, in seating order (hopefully you're playing
with actual people--if not, it's okay, we've all been there).
Then hit <enter> when you're done.

Follow the GUI's instructions. It will have you pass around the
computer to each person so that they will find out which
character they are playing, their teammates, or if they're the
kingpin, who is on the other teams/who is Snape, if there is one.

=====================================================================

SPECIAL STUFF:

=====================================================================

Currently Snape is not always in each game-- there is a ~50% chance
that he is. Might add support for the user to say whether they
always want a Snape or not.

Might add support for a user to go back and read all their info
if they run out of time. Currently they have 15 secs to do so.
